# LPS-TLR-sepsis-in-mice
A longitudinal + repeated measurements analysis in randomized controlled groups (3): treatment, control, treatment + genetic variation

This project has two major goals:
1. finding an early biomarker indicative of sepsis diagnosis from protein species in the blood
2. probing the mechanistic role of TLR receptor in LPS induced sepsis in mice
